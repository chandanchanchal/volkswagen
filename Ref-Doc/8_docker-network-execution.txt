docker run -d --name c1 --net none busybox sleep 10000 # will keep container running for 10000 sec.
docker exec -it c1 /bin/ash # will attach a shell to container
#now check for network interfaces with ifconfig command ,you will find only loopback ip
#lets go with below command for checking out cidr of default bridge interface
docker netwrok inspect bridge
# now we will create one custom bridge interface named as my_bridge-network
docker network create --driver bridge my_bridge-network
docker run -d --name dbd1 busybox sleep 10000 # this will create dbd1 container to default bridge.
docker exec -it dbd1 /bin/ash # connect to container. # connect container via first terminal
docker run -d --net my_bridge-network --name cbd1 busybox sleep 10000 # this will create cbd1 container to custom bridge
docker exec -it cbd1 /bin/ash # connect to container. # connect container via second terminal
# now ping dbd1 from dbd1 and vi versa and you will find neighter of them piniging to each other.
docker network connect bridge cbd1 # connect cbd1 to default bridge and you will find ping got started. connect command we
# have to run for second container too if we want to ping from second to first one.
# now ping from dbd1 to cbd1 and vise versa it will not get pingeed eighter way.
docker network disconnect bridge cbd1 # to stop ping

docker run -d --name hc1 --net host busybox seeep 10000 # will create hc1 to host interface 
docker exec -it hc1 /bin/ash # connect to container. and run ifconfig you will find all host network interfaces are here
